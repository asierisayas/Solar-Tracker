# Smartphone Solar Tracker
Smartphone Solar Tracker uses a mobile device to detect sunlight and orient a solar panel for optimal
position. The project promotes the utilization of unused devices such as an old smartphone that has
been replaced by a newer model. 
The project has four main components: Smartphone camera, application, pan and tilt unit and acrylic
frame holding the solar panel. The camera detects brightness of the sun, the application controls the
pan and tilt unit, and the unit moves the frame which holds the solar panel and the smartphone. The "scan" functionality in the application rotates the pan and tilt unit position until it is
roughly facing the sun. The "auto" feature in the application further orients the
unit so that the panel is directly facing the sun using the camera on the smartphone. Another option of
the application is manual control, sliders will enable the user to orient the solar panels as they wish.
